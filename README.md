## CAELO-LUCIAN CALENDAR CONVERTER

    The following project is meant to adapt the modern Gregorian Calendar, used in the real world, and convert each month / day to its exact equivalent in the fictional Caelo-Lucian Calendar system.

    The Caelo-Lucian Calendar is used in the world of my Greco-Roman fantasy novel series: DEORUM LEGIONS™.


## LUCIAN CALENDAR LOGIC 

    [-] Like in our world, there are a total of 365 days...

    [-] But there are 13 months instead of 12...

    [-] Each Lucian month is exactly 28 days long...

    [-] All 13 months equate to 364 days...

    [-] The last (365th) day is a special day commemorating the sacred Velcanalia festival...

    [-] There are no Leap Years in the Lucian Calendar, thus Feb 29 will not be included...


## LUCIAN CALENDAR MONTHS 

    MONTH 01: Primus -------- 28 Days
    MONTH 02: Romulus ------- 28 Days
    MONTH 03: Sol ----------- 28 Days
    MONTH 04: Martius ------- 28 Days
    MONTH 05: Quintillus ---- 28 Days
    MONTH 06: Sextillus ----- 28 Days
    MONTH 07: Septimus ------ 28 Days
    MONTH 08: Octavus ------- 28 Days
    MONTH 09: Novembus ------ 28 Days
    MONTH 10: Decembus ------ 28 Days
    MONTH 11: Jupitus ------- 28 Days
    Month 12: Minervus ------ 28 Days
    Month 13: Quirinus ------ 28 Days
    DAY 365: Velcanalia ----- 01 Day


## LUCIAN CALENDAR DAYS

    Additionally, each day of the week is also slightly different from the ones we typcially use in the real world. Like in the Gregorian scheme, there are 7 distinct days. But given the equal distribution of days across the 13 months, the days remain the same every week, every month, ever year within the Lucian scheme. They do not shift.

    The one exception is the final (365th) day of the year, which is simply called Velcanalia Day. The days are as follows:

    Monday ====== Lunis
    Tuesday ===== Martis
    Wednesday === Mercurius
    Thursday ==== Jovis
    Friday ====== Veneris
    Saturday ==== Saturnis
    Sunday ====== Solis


## CONVERSION GOALS

    The goal is effectively to have the user input a day and have the code automatically convert that into its Lucian equivalent with the day accounted for as well.

    For example, if my birthday is: July 10
    Then the output should be: Septimus 23, Martis
    (The year however shall not be factored in.)
